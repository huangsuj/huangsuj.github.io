I am currently a master student in College of Computer and Data Science, Fuzhou University, also a member of [Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Network Computing and Intelligent Information Processing](https://ncip.fzu.edu.cn/). I am advised by [Prof. Shiping Wang](https://ccds.fzu.edu.cn/info/1202/8958.htm) and my mentor [Dr. Zhaoliang Chen](https://chenzl23.github.io/). Before that, I majored in computer science and obtained my B.S. degree from the College of Computer and Data Science, Fuzhou University, in 2021. From Feb 2023 to Sep 2023, I was also a visiting student/research assistant in School of Data Science, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, advised by [Prof. Jicong Fan](https://jicongfan.github.io/). My research interests include graph neural networks, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning. I have published over 10 papers on top-tier conferences and journals, including NeurIPS, AAAI, IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TMM, Neural Networks, etc.
