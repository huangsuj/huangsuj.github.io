I am currently a master student in College of Computer and Data Science, Fuzhou University, also a member of [Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Network Computing and Intelligent Information Processing](https://ncip.fzu.edu.cn/). I am advised by [Prof. Shiping Wang](https://ccds.fzu.edu.cn/info/1202/8958.htm). Before that, I majored in computer science and obtained my B.S. degree from the School of Computer and Information Engineering, Jiangxi Normal University, in 2021. My research interests include graph neural networks, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning.
